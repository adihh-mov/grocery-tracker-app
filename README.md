# grocery-tracker-app

A minimalist mobile app built with React Native (Expo) to help track household grocery items and when they might run out â€” so you never forget the essentials again (especially chaipatti ðŸ˜‰).

## ðŸ’¡ Backstory

One day, my mom came back from grocery shopping and said:  
> "Oh no! I forgot to buy chaipatti again."  

That moment sparked an idea â€” what if there was a simple app where she could:
- Add items when bought
- Enter how many days they usually last
- And get a gentle reminder before they run out?

So I decided to build it, even though I was a total beginner at coding.
